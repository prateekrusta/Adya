# Adya
There is an entrepreneurial surge amongst women entrepreneurs during this pandemic and women entrepreneurs are coming forward in India but they definitely need mentoring support from experts to sustain the business. Here is where Adya plays an important role to handhold entrepreneurs in every stage of their business. Adya is an initiative to promote and support aspiring as well as established rural women entrepreneurs. Adya enables partnerships between Rural women and existing ventures. Our services would be dependent on a tie-up with self-help groups, non-governmental organizations, already-existing businesses, banks, and government agencies.  The venture also aims at building a bridge between manufacturers (of handicrafts) and the consumers. There is a vast market for the products both on national as well as global level. A supply chain will have to be established and the whole process needs to be simplified. This can be done easily with the help of technology. We offer all the services at a single place, so the customers (rural women) do not have to seek support of any other organization.
